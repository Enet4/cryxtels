# Crystal Pixels - modern version

Crystal Pixels (Cryxtels in short) is a simulator game where you live in a dark and cold microcosm, imagined and brought to life by Alessandro Gighnola, who is mostly known for developing the space simulator game Noctis. You can fly to small spaces called pixels, with several other features, such as walking around them and creating pixels and objects.

Cryxtels was initially an MS-DOS game. Later on, a port was developed in order to be playable in modern systems such as Linux. This repository contains the latest development versions of this port.

At the moment, this version was only tested to work on Linux.

## Building

Run *configure* to generate the Makefile's, then run *make*.

Others building procedures for more operating systems could be available eventually.

# Installing

Place the compiled executable in the bin directory. Symlinks for running cryxtels in the console can be made manually.

# Running

Before you start playing, please read *crystal pixels.txt* and *readme new.txt* to understand it.
To run the game, simply execute cryxtels. Make sure that PIXELS.DEF and all .ATM files are in the same directory. Simple Directmedia Library version 2 must be installed in the system.
